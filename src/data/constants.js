Desired room types dominate with 18,160 bookings and 8,010 cancellations. Month-wise Analysis: Monthly trends showing total bookings and cancellations. September and October show the highest bookings, while cancellations peak in July and September. Hotel Type Analysis: Distribution of bookings and cancellations between City Hotels and Resort Hotels.
